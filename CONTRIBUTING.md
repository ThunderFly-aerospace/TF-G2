# How to contribute

The TF-G2 autogyro project is open-source. All source data is publicly available in the git repository. The project is being developed by the community, which aims to develop a high-quality unmanned aircraft for various missions in hard weather conditions. 

## How to start?
It depends if you have some aim, what you want to reach with TF-G2 autogyro (even for your own use) or you won't just help us. 

### I'm missing some features on the TF-G2 autogyro
Simply create a fork o [TF-G2](https://github.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/TF-G2) repository; create modifications there and create back a pull-request to [upstream repository](https://github.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/TF-G2). 

If you are not sure how to create that modification, where to place it or you have another problem with it - let us know. Write some [issue](https://github.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/TF-G2/issues) or create a thread in [discussion](https://github.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/TF-G2/discussions) Simply create a gyroscope fork. Create modifications here and create a pull-request for us. If you are not sure how to create the thing, where to place it or you have another problem with it. Let us know.

### I would like to help, I like this project - I don't know how and with what
The easiest thing is to write to us in the repository discussion. And we can discuss together what would entertain or interest you. Another way is to look to the issues where is the list the currently known issues. 

### Language
You may have noticed that the content of our issues is mostly written in Czech (so far). It is, therefore, that our core-team is based in the Czech Republic and our mature language is Czech. But now, we are training to write titles of issues (at least) in English.

If you are interested in a headline, you can try to translate the content of an issue with some online translators. Or write comment that you are interested in that issue and you want to know more information in english. We try to describe it in English or translate that issue content.

We try to have general texts about the project written in English.
